- Hookup REST API through Redux Saga
- Hookup GraphQL API through Redux Saga
- Styled Components
- Babel (transpiler)

UNIX cmds and other bash/zsh thingys and other apps and shit
- cat / more

## Knowledge Dump

_What is a lock file?_

A lock file basically shoves all of the depedencies map into an autogenerated file a tool can reference to install packages more optimally. Don't modify this. It's autogenerated.

_Server Setup_

- Install dependencies
  - Express
  - Nodemon
  - Body Parser (for JSON on server)
  - Path
- Setup npm scripts  
  - dev scripts
    - npm-run-all
  - Prod script

_Why do we use `Webpack Dev Server` and `Express` for development?_

We need express to do any hookups with APIs. In production, we use express to serve the application. Webpack dev server is only for local development. It detects diffs in our project and re-builds it, which Express can't do. We also have set-up react-hot-loader to re-render only the components that have changed.
